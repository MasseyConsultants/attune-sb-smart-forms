## Sprint 1 Task Status

| #   | Task                  | Status  | Notes                                                                  |
| --- | --------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Entitlements module   | ✅ Done | check/consume/overrides, anchor-day periods, guard, LIMIT_EXCEEDED 402 |
| 2   | Stripe billing module | ✅ Done | checkout, portal, 5 idempotent webhook handlers, price catalog via env |
| 3   | Trial abuse hardening | ✅ Done | domain heuristic on signup (S0) + card fingerprint hash on checkout    |
| 4   | Web entitlement hooks | ✅ Done | useEntitlement/useUsage/useCheckout, billing BFF, UpgradeCta, /billing |
| 5   | Exhaustive tests      | ✅ Done | 112 tests: plan×meter matrix, replays, webhook fixtures, auth debt     |

## Sprint 1 Verification (2026-07-12)

- 112 API tests green across 7 suites (entitlement matrix: 4 plans × 5 periodic
  meters × under/at-limit boundaries; soft-warn latch; idempotent consume replay)
- Live smoke: `GET /billing/usage` returns all 6 meters with trial limits and
  anchor-day period (13th); `GET /billing/subscription` reports TRIALING
- Webhook replay (same event id) verified a no-op via recorded fixtures
- With no Stripe keys: trial flows fully work; checkout/portal fail fast with
  `BILLING_NOT_CONFIGURED` (503) — pinned by spec
- `/billing` page renders plan, usage meters with 80%/100% color thresholds,
  and checkout/portal actions (manual Stripe checkout verification pending keys)

## Sprint 2 Task Status

| #   | Task                       | Status    | Notes                                                                   |
| --- | -------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Org lifecycle FSM          | ✅ Done   | EXPIRED_TRIAL/CANCELED/PURGE_PENDING/PURGED, ReadOnlyGuard, restore     |

| 3   | Reminder + warning emails  | ✅ Done   | Trial/cancel schedule, soft-limit 80% latch email, dunning first-notice |
| 4   | Billing/plan pages + UI    | ✅ Done\* | Plan grid from PLAN_ENTITLEMENTS, meters, read-only banner; \*SB-014/15 |
| 5   | Per-plan API throttling    | ✅ Done   | OrgThrottlerGuard reads apiRateLimitPerMin from plan snapshot           |
| 6   | First web component tests  | ✅ Done   | 18 tests: MeterBar, UpgradeCta, ReadOnlyBanner, PlanGrid                |

## Sprint 2 Verification (2026-07-13)

- 130 API tests across 8 suites; 18 web tests across 4 suites — all green
- Live drill: backdated trial → sweep → org `EXPIRED_TRIAL`, read-only flag
  set, purge scheduled +30d, T+0 reminder email logged
- Read-only org: `PATCH /organizations/me` → `ORG_READ_ONLY`; GET still 200
- SSR check: dashboard renders the read-only banner + purge date; `/billing`
  renders all three plan cards, meters, and current-plan state
- Downgrade form-picker UX + export-all deferred to S4 (SB-014, SB-015 —
  need forms/submissions to exist)

## Sprint 3 Task Status

| #   | Task                        | Status  | Notes                                                                   |

| 2   | Forms API module            | ✅ Done | CRUD + DRAFT→PUBLISHED→ARCHIVED FSM, immutable versions, slug alloc     |
| 3   | activeForms publish gating  | ✅ Done | Live-count via entitlements; LIMIT_EXCEEDED 402 with upgrade URL        |
| 4   | Form builder studio UI      | ✅ Done | Zustand store, dnd-kit palette/canvas/inspector, live preview, autosave |
| 5   | Forms list + nav            | ✅ Done | List page w/ status/version, create/delete; Forms nav enabled           |
| 6   | Tests                       | ✅ Done | 24 forms API specs, 15 builder-store/forms-list web tests               |

## Sprint 3 Verification (2026-07-13)

- 154 API tests across 9 suites; 32 web tests across 6 suites; 42 form-engine
  tests across 4 suites — all green
- Live API drill (trial org, cap 2): publish×2 OK → 3rd publish returns
  `LIMIT_EXCEEDED {limit:2, current:2, upgradeUrl}` → unpublish frees the slot
  → 3rd publishes → republish bumps to v2 with immutable v1+v2 snapshots
- `GET /billing/usage` now reports live activeForms counts (2/2 at cap)
- Builder UI click-through (create → drag fields → conditional rule → preview
  → publish-at-cap upgrade prompt) — pending manual pass at Phase 2 close
- dnd-kit dependency recorded in `docs/ADR/0001-dnd-kit-for-form-builder.md`

## Sprint 4 Task Status

| #   | Task                        | Status  | Notes                                                                    |
| --- | --------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Submissions API module      | ✅ Done | Public intake w/ honeypot + IP throttle; OVER_LIMIT quarantine; metering |
| 2   | Public fill pages /f/[slug] | ✅ Done | SSR no-store, mobile card layout, plan-gated "Powered by", vague 404     |
| 3   | Data views + export         | ✅ Done | Schema-derived table, detail expand, CSV/XLSX (exceljs, ADR-0002)        |
| 4   | Submission counts on list   | ✅ Done | `_count` aggregate replaces S3 placeholder; links to data view           |
| 5   | SB-014 downgrade picker     | ✅ Done | Billing card appears when published > cap; org chooses what stays live   |
| 6   | SB-015 export-all           | ✅ Done | "Export your data" takeout card on /billing; works in read-only mode     |
| 7   | Phase 2 close               | ✅ Done | Run instructions + seed credentials + click-through checklist delivered  |

## Sprint 4 Verification (2026-07-13)

- 170 API tests across 10 suites; 35 web tests across 7 suites — all green
- Live intake drill (public, unauthenticated): valid submission stored
  `SUBMITTED` + metered; missing-required rejected 422 with field errors;
  honeypot hit returned fake 201 id and stored NOTHING
- Browser drill: `/f/qejfjr3fw8` SSR-rendered with "Powered by" footer,
  filled + submitted → branded thank-you screen; unknown slug → 404 page
- Quarantine (at-cap intake → OVER_LIMIT → lazy release on headroom) covered
  by unit tests; end-to-end pass is on the manual checklist (needs 50 rows)
- Form-engine `./logic` subpath export lets the API validate against the
  published snapshot without pulling React into the Nest build

## Sprint 5 Task Status

| #   | Task                     | Status  | Notes                                                                    |

| 6   | Tests                    | ✅ Done | 15 API specs (inspector + service), 16 web specs (guides, sidebar, tag)  |

## Sprint 5 Verification (2026-07-13)

- 185 API tests across 12 suites; 51 web tests across 10 suites — all green
- Live smoke (trial org, cap 1): PDF upload → `READY` with correct page
  count/dims; 2nd upload → `LIMIT_EXCEEDED {limit:1, current:1, upgradeUrl}`;
  PDF streams 200; PATCH links form; PUT mappings persists; out-of-bounds page
  mapping rejected 400; DELETE 204 removes blobs + row
- Lifecycle integration: purge phase 1 now deletes `document-templates/{orgId}`
  blobs; soft/hard delete cover forms/submissions/templates rows
- `uploadedTemplates` counted resource is live (was structurally 0 since S1)
- DOCX conversion path ported (mammoth + Puppeteer, `waitUntil: 'load'`);
  manual DOCX upload verification on the S6 checklist
- SmartMapper mapping types centralized in `@attune-sb/shared-types`
  (enterprise had them duplicated in API + admin UI)

## Sprint 6 Task Status

| #   | Task                    | Status  | Notes                                                                       |
| --- | ----------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Stage 1 auto-mapping    | ✅ Done | pdfjs extract + fuzzball match, suggest-mappings endpoint, scanned-PDF gate |
| 2   | Candidate review UI     | ✅ Done | Canvas overlays w/ accept/reject/nudge, candidates panel, bulk actions      |
| 3   | Document fill runtime   | ✅ Done | pdf-lib stamping (value/checkmark/highlight/signature), intake hook         |
| 4   | DOC_FILLS metering      | ✅ Done | Assert-before/consume-after; at cap fill skipped, submission never dropped  |
| 5   | STORAGE_BYTES live sums | ✅ Done | Templates + fills aggregate; upload asserts headroom; deletes reclaim       |
| 6   | Tests                   | ✅ Done | 40 new API specs (fuzzy/geometry/filler/fills/extract), 10 new web specs    |
| 7   | Phase 3 close           | ✅ Done | E2E smoke script green; retro + S7 draft written                            |

## Sprint 6 Verification (2026-07-13)

- 225 API tests across 17 suites; 61 web tests across 12 suites; 42 form-engine
  tests — all green; lint + typecheck clean
- Live E2E smoke (`scripts/smoke-sprint6.ps1`): 10-field form + fixture PDF →
  auto-map suggested 10/10 (100% ≥ 70% acceptance bar) → mappings saved →
  publish → public submission → filled PDF stored + downloaded; text extraction
  of the output confirmed every value stamped beside its label
- Meters after the run: DOC_FILLS 1/10, SUBMISSIONS 3/50, STORAGE_BYTES 3,166
  bytes (template 1,230 + fill 1,936 — live sum verified after cache TTL)
- Trial caps exercised incidentally: `uploadedTemplates` 1/1 and
  `activeForms` 2/2 both returned `LIMIT_EXCEEDED` with upgrade URL mid-drill
- `normalizeLabel` parenthetical-stripping bug found in the enterprise source
  fixed here with a regression test

## Sprint 7 Task Status

| #   | Task                    | Status  | Notes                                                                      |
| --- | ----------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Workflows API module    | ✅ Done | 4 models + migration, CRUD, publish FSM w/ version snapshots, run pinning  |
| 2   | Graph validation        | ✅ Done | Enterprise rules + dup-id/unknown-type checks; trigger-form required       |
| 3   | Plan-tier node gate     | ✅ Done | Above-tier node on publish → 402 LIMIT_EXCEEDED w/ node list + upgrade URL |
| 4   | Orchestrator + adapters | ✅ Done | BullMQ queue, routing (branch labels, failure edges), 6 core adapters      |
| 5   | Trigger + WORKFLOW_RUNS | ✅ Done | Intake hook (never-throw), assert-before/consume-after, SKIPPED_LIMIT rows |

| 7   | Tests                   | ✅ Done | 71 new API specs: walks, adapters, cap matrix, publish FSM, trigger        |

## Sprint 7 Verification (2026-07-13)

- 296 API tests across 23 suites; 61 web tests; 42 form-engine tests — all
  green; lint + typecheck clean workspace-wide
- Live E2E smoke (`scripts/smoke-sprint7.ps1`): published a
  start→fill_document→send_document→notify→end workflow bound to a mapped
  form → public submission → BullMQ run COMPLETED with a 5-step ledger
  (fill reused the intake fill in 1ms; send emailed the PDF attachment in
  215ms) → WORKFLOW_RUNS 0→1, EMAILS 0→1
- Tier gate verified live: publishing an approval node on the trial org
  returned 402 `LIMIT_EXCEEDED` with the upgrade URL
- Cap semantics: WORKFLOW_RUNS at cap → run recorded SKIPPED_LIMIT (no
  enqueue, no consume, submission untouched); EMAILS/DOC_FILLS at cap →
  step SKIPPED, run continues — unit-tested matrix
- Purge sweep extended: workflows/runs soft+hard delete, `workflow-artifacts/`
  blob prefix removal, tombstone entity counts include workflows

## Sprint 8 Task Status

| #   | Task                     | Status  | Notes                                                                    |

## Sprint 8 Verification (2026-07-13)

- 368 API tests across 26 suites; 68 web tests across 13 suites; 42
  form-engine tests — all green; lint + typecheck clean
- Live E2E smoke (`scripts/smoke-sprint8.ps1`): approval workflow publish
  → 402 on trial (tier gate) → growth override → published → public
  submission → run PAUSED at approval → public token decision → run
  COMPLETED down the Approved branch; token reuse → 410 Gone; webhook to
  `169.254.169.254` refused by the SSRF guard, run completed via failure edge
- Browser click-through: workflows list, builder canvas (6 Growth nodes
  locked with upgrade CTA on the trial org), node config panel with
  `{{token}}` hints, runs view with expanded step ledger
- P4 Workflow Builder phase closed — all three flagship systems now live

## Sprint 9 Task Status

| #   | Task                   | Status  | Notes                                                                      |
| --- | ---------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Library shared types   | ✅ Done | 8 categories, summary/detail/clone/publish contracts in shared-types       |
| 2   | LibraryTemplate + API  | ✅ Done | PUBLIC/ORG scopes, @Public browse + detail, clone → DRAFTs, publish gate   |
| 3   | Curated seed content   | ✅ Done | 27 templates across all 8 categories; 3 bundle workflows; idempotent seed  |
| 4   | Gallery UI             | ✅ Done | Public /gallery + /gallery/[slug] SSR; in-app /library w/ one-click clone  |
| 5   | In-app notifications   | ✅ Done | Model + feed API, bell w/ unread badge; 4 emitters wired (usage/approval/  |
|     |                        |         | workflow-failed/trial-reminder)                                            |
| 6   | Branding gate audit    | ✅ Done | Fixed thank-you screen dropping the "Powered by" footer; emails verified   |
| 7   | Admin console (SB-016) | ✅ Done | PLATFORM_ADMIN org list/detail, legal hold, restore, override CRUD + UI    |
| 8   | Tests                  | ✅ Done | 108 new API specs incl. per-template seed validation; 10 new web specs     |

## Sprint 9 Verification (2026-07-13)

- 476 API tests across 30 suites; 78 web tests across 15 suites; 42
  form-engine tests — all green; lint + typecheck clean workspace-wide
- Live E2E smoke (`scripts/smoke-sprint9.ps1`, 11 steps): unauthenticated
  gallery browse (27 templates) + detail by slug → owner clone lands a DRAFT
  form → notifications feed live → customer OWNER 403 on /admin/orgs →
  publish-org-template 402 on trial (publishOrgTemplates gate) → platform
  admin lists orgs, reads usage/members/counts, creates + deletes an
  entitlement override, toggles legal hold → public /gallery SSR 200
- Seed-data spec validates every curated template against the real publish
  validator + workflow graph validator — a broken template cannot ship
- Admin nav item renders only for PLATFORM_ADMIN (role check server-side in
  the dashboard layout; API guard enforces independently)
- SB-018/SB-019 follow-up (post-review, same day): 483 API tests across 31
  suites; 83 web tests across 16 suites — all green. Live team smoke (7
  checks): accept under cap creates account → invite at cap 402
  LIMIT_EXCEEDED → accept at cap 402 with invite left pending → member list /
  role change / deactivate round-trip → invite succeeds again after the seat
  frees
- Owner-testing polish (2026-07-14): sidebar brand decorations; org-wide
  /submissions view (form/member filters, JSON text search, CSV export);
  SB-020 form-first workflow UX — start node renders the bound form as a
  card (name + fields + friendly types), start config binds the trigger form
  in-canvas, clickable field chips insert {{tokens}} in every token-capable
  node config. 18 web suites / 95 tests green; verified live in the builder
- PDF pipeline + library expansion (2026-07-14): pdf_generate now renders
  human field labels in form order with section headers (schema-driven via
  the trigger form; signature/photo answers summarized, not base64-dumped);
  send_document falls back to the org owner when no recipient is configured
  (matches notify); notify accepts both `message` and `body` config keys.
  Library grew 27 → 37 curated templates — 10 new document-first templates
  (service estimate, invoice, service agreement, rental application, W-9
  onboarding w/ fill_document, expense reimbursement w/ approval, daily job
  site report, cleaning completion, appointment request, membership
  application) plus PDF workflows added to 3 existing templates (liability
  waiver, incident report, service completion). 526 API / 96 web tests
  green. Live smoke (`scripts/smoke-pdf-library.ps1`): clone → publish form
  - workflow → public submit → run COMPLETED with pdf_generate +
    send_document; generated PDF inspected — labels, sections, [Signed] ✓
- Document blueprints (2026-07-15): library templates can now bundle a
  code-generated, pre-mapped professional PDF (`document-blueprints.ts` —
  the PDF artwork and its FieldCoordinateMappings come from the same layout
  constants, so coordinates cannot drift). Cloning materializes the
  blueprint as a READY DocumentTemplate linked to the new form (skipped
  gracefully at the uploadedTemplates cap). Two new quote templates ship on
  it: Contractor Job Quote and Framing & Drywall Quote (dimension-driven) —
  submit the form, the branded quote PDF fills itself and emails the
  customer + owner with zero setup (37 → 39 templates). Found + fixed: seed
  workflows that fanned out two unlabeled edges from one node silently
  dropped the second branch (the walker follows one edge) — service
  agreement re-chained, seed spec now forbids unlabeled fan-out. 528 API /
  96 web tests green. Live smoke (`scripts/smoke-quote-blueprints.ps1`,
  14 checks): clone → document READY w/ 15 mappings linked to the clone →
  publish → public submit → run COMPLETED, quote PDF filled + emailed to
  customer and owner; filled PDF rendered and visually verified
- Library Wave 1 (2026-07-16, SB-028): +36 P0 templates (gallery **39 → 75**).
  New blueprints: change-order, punch-list, auto-repair-estimate,
  booking-contract, permission-slip, bakery-order, direct-deposit-auth
  (plus reused contractor-quote for electrical/plumbing/HVAC). Coverage:
  trades closeout/quotes, auto estimate, salon/tattoo/trainer, musician +
  photo contracts, coaching/SOW/MSP, dental/vet, property, food, camp/
  donation, website lead, PO, vendor onboard. Seed module split:
  `library-seed-wave1.ts` + helpers. Library seed specs: ≥70 templates,
  ≥25 document workflows; 392 library-module tests green; DB seeded 75.
- Library Wave 2 (2026-07-16, SB-028): +48 P1 templates (gallery **75 → 123**).
  New blueprints: service-report, records-release (11 engines total; **21**
  templates carry mapped PDF blueprints; others Tier B/C or pdf_generate).
  Vertical depth: landscaping/painting/pest, auto/tow, beauty/medspa, DJ/
  venue, agency/tax, chiro/counseling/telehealth, realty, food truck/retail,
  after-school/volunteer, HR exit/near-miss. Seed: `library-seed-wave2.ts`.
  Specs ≥110 templates / ≥40 doc workflows; 632 library-module tests; DB 123.
- Library browse (2026-07-16, SB-029): industry tags (`tags String[]`, 34
  facets), API filters (`tag`, `search` matches tags, `hasDocument`,
  `hasWorkflow`), public `/gallery` + in-app `/library` share search/industry/
  category/capability controls with URL-synced public filters.

| 2   | Production seed safety        | ✅ Done     | Demo orgs dev-only; prod admin requires PLATFORM_ADMIN_PASSWORD env          |
| 3   | trust proxy (real client IPs) | ✅ Done     | main.ts — @Ip()/throttles read X-Forwarded-For behind nginx                  |

| 5   | Deploy pipeline (GHCR + SSH)  | ✅ Done     | deploy.yml — AUTO on green CI (owner decision; re-gate before customers)     |
| 6   | Docs                          | ✅ Done     | docs/DEPLOYMENT.md (VPS + Azure pathways), ADR-0005                          |
| 7   | Remaining hardening           | Not started | Backups/restore drill, Stripe live, Resend domain, uptime, semantic-release  |
| 8   | Platform Ops console (SB-025) | ✅ Done     | 2026-07-16 — fast-tracked P1: ops event ledger, RED metrics, queue inspector |

## Sprint 10 Verification (2026-07-16 — Platform Ops console, SB-025)

- New `/admin/ops` console (Platform nav, PLATFORM_ADMIN only) with five tabs:
  Overview (DB/Redis health + latency, uptime/memory, 60-min traffic chart
  with p50/p95/p99, queue depths, 24h error/security counts, business stats,
  recent workflow failures), Errors & Security (filterable `OpsEvent` ledger
  with expandable rows), Queues (BullMQ counts + failed-job retry/discard),
  Webhooks (Stripe idempotency ledger browser), Usage Hotspots (orgs ≥70% of
  any plan meter — the MASTER_PLAN expansion-pipeline view)
- Closed the deferred P6 note in `http-exception.filter.ts`: 5xx →
  `API_ERROR` events, 403 → `authz.denied` SECURITY events; unhandled
  exceptions → CRITICAL. Auth wired: `auth.login_failed`,
  `auth.account_locked`, `auth.refresh_reuse` (CRITICAL); Stripe:
  `webhook.signature_failed` (CRITICAL). Recording is fire-and-forget — a
  broken ledger can never break the request path
- New `OpsEvent` model + migration `20260716155119_ops_events` (no-FK org/user
  refs survive purges); daily `ops-maintenance` BullMQ sweep prunes past
  `OPS_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30)
- prom-client (ADR-0006): default Node metrics + HTTP histogram with
  cardinality-bounded route labels; Prometheus scrape at `GET /api/v1/metrics`
  guarded by `METRICS_TOKEN` (404 when unset); in-memory 60-min RED window
  powers the console without a Prometheus deployment
- API: `admin/ops/*` endpoints (overview, events, queues, retry/discard,
  webhooks, usage-hotspots) behind Roles(PLATFORM_ADMIN) + AllowReadOnly;
  web: catch-all allow-listed BFF proxy + `use-admin-ops` hooks
- 633 API tests / 34 suites green (incl. 3 new ops suites + updated
  auth/webhook/filter specs); lint + typecheck clean API and web

## Sprint 10 Verification (2026-07-15 — FIRST PRODUCTION DEPLOY LIVE)

- **Production is live at `https://sfsb.attuneitus.com`** — first automated
  deploy (commit `5dfc871`) went green end to end: CI → Deploy (build-push
  4m36s, deploy 1m49s) → GHCR images pulled on the VPS → stack rolled →
  workflow health check passed
- Verified from outside the VPS: `/api/v1/health` 200
  `{status: ok, version: 0.1.0}` (migrations + production seed ran on boot);
  `/login` 200 in ~0.2 s over valid TLS (Let's Encrypt, HTTP→HTTPS redirect)
- Pipeline is now fully automated: push to main → green CI → auto-deploy.
  Rollback = manual Deploy run with `image_tag` of a prior SHA
  (`/opt/attune-sb/deploy-history.log` on the server)
- Deploy-day fixes: GHCR tag lowercased (org name is mixed-case), deploy job
  granted `packages: read`, lost `github-actions-deploy` key regenerated
  (Ed25519) + old key removed from authorized_keys, firewalld SSH rich rule
  (3/min rate limit) removed — it was timing out the Actions runners
- Still pending for sprint close: owner browser click-through (signup →
  build → publish → public submit over HTTPS), then task 7 hardening

## Sprint 10 Verification (2026-07-15, partial — pre-first-deploy)

- Both production images build clean from the repo root (api ~4 min cold,
  web ~70 s); lockfile updated for the prisma dep move
- Local smoke of the full prod stack (`docker-compose.prod.yml` + test .env):
  boot ran all 9 migrations + production seed (3 plans, platform admin from
  env, 39 library templates — NO demo orgs); `/api/v1/health` 200; web /login
  200; Chromium 150 headless PDF render inside the api container OK
- End-to-end signup through the web BFF (web container → api container over
  the compose network): 201, org + OWNER + trial created, httpOnly cookies set
- 615 API tests / 31 suites, 96 web tests / 18 suites, lint + typecheck —
  all green after the changes (trust proxy, prod-aware seed, tracing root)
- Still pending for sprint close: first real deploy to the VPS (needs DNS +
  `.env` + GitHub secrets/environment), then task 7 hardening
